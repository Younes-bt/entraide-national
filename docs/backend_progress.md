*Generated by Copilot - Last Updated: May 6, 2025*

## Development Timeline

This document tracks the progress of the Entraide National backend development and serves as a reference for next steps.

### Completed Tasks

#### Initial Project Setup (May 2025)
- [x] Created Django project structure
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL database connection
- [x] Configured environment variables
- [x] Added internationalization support
- [x] Integrated Cloudinary for file storage

#### Authentication System (May 2025)
- [x] Created custom User model with roles
- [x] Implemented JWT authentication
- [x] Added token refresh and blacklisting for logout
- [x] Created account serializers (UserSerializer, UserProfileSerializer)
- [x] Implemented user registration, profile, and password change views
- [x] Added comprehensive tests for accounts app
- [x] Set up API documentation with Swagger/ReDoc
- [x] Enhanced API documentation with detailed examples and descriptions
- [x] Created custom admin interface for user management

### Current Status

The project currently has a fully functional authentication and user management system with:

- Complete API endpoints for user management
- API documentation with detailed descriptions and examples
- Comprehensive tests for the accounts app
- Enhanced admin interface for user management

The following apps have their initial models created but require serializers and API views:
- associations
- attendance
- centers
- exams
- programs
- schedule
- students
- teachers

4. **Documentation and Deployment**
   - [ ] Complete API documentation
   - [ ] Create deployment guides
   - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Debt and Improvements

- Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data
- Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- Enhance error handling and custom exception responses
- Consider implementing GraphQL alongside REST API for complex queries
- Implement more granular permissions system
- Add comprehensive logging

## Development Standards

- All new features should include tests
- Keep API documentation updated with any changes
- Maintain backward compatibility when updating existing endpoints
- Follow PEP 8 for code style
- Add appropriate comments and docstrings
