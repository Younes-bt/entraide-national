## Overview

The Entraide National API is a RESTful interface that provides access to all features of the Entraide National Management System. The API is built using Django REST Framework and follows REST principles.

All API responses are in JSON format. The API uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and versioning to ensure backward compatibility.

**Base URL**:
- Development: `http://localhost:8000/api/`
- Production: `https://api.entraide-national.ma/api/`

**Available API Documentation Interfaces**:
- Swagger UI: `/swagger/`
- ReDoc: `/redoc/`
- OpenAPI Schema: `/swagger.json` or `/swagger.yaml`

**Supported User Roles**:
- `admin`: Administrator
- `center_supervisor`: Center Supervisor
- `association_supervisor`: Association Supervisor
- `trainer`: Trainer
- `student`: Student

---

## Authentication

The API uses JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication. To access protected endpoints, you must include a valid access token in the Authorization header of your requests.

### Obtaining Tokens

To obtain authentication tokens, send a POST request to the token endpoint with your credentials.

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/token/`

**Request Format**:
```json
{
    "email": "your.email@example.com",
    "password": "yourpassword"
}
```

**Response Format**:
```json
{
    "refresh": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
    "access": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

The response contains two tokens:
- `access`: Used for authentication (valid for 24 hours)
- `refresh`: Used to obtain new access tokens (valid for 7 days)

### Using Tokens

Include the access token in the Authorization header of your requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### Refreshing Tokens

When the access token expires, use the refresh token to obtain a new one.

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/token/refresh/`

**Request Format**:
```json
{
    "refresh": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

**Response Format**:
```json
{
    "access": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

### Logging Out

To log out, blacklist the refresh token by sending a POST request to the logout endpoint.

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/accounts/users/logout/`

**Request Format**:
```json
{
    "refresh": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

**Response Format**:
```json
{
    "detail": "Successfully logged out."
}
```

### Centers Management

The Centers Management module provides API endpoints for managing centers, rooms, equipment, and groups within centers. The base path for these endpoints is `/api/centers-app/`.

**Permissions**:
- **Admin**: Full CRUD access to Centers. Full CRUD access to Rooms, Equipment, and Groups.
- **Center Supervisor**: Read-only access to Centers they supervise (via filtering, direct listing of all centers is admin only). Full CRUD access to Rooms, Equipment, and Groups *within the centers they supervise*.
- **Authenticated Users**: Generally, read-only access if permitted by endpoint configuration (currently most list views are restricted to Admin/Supervisors).

**Filtering**: These endpoints support filtering using `django-filter`. For example, to filter rooms by type: `/api/centers-app/rooms/?type=classroom`.

**Nested Data**:
- Retrieving a specific `Center` will include a list of its `Rooms` and `Groups`.
- Retrieving a specific `Room` will include a list of its `Equipment`.

The base path for these endpoints is `/api/associations/`. These endpoints provide CRUD operations for managing associations.

**Permissions**:
- **Admin**: Full CRUD access to all associations.
- **Association Supervisor**: Future implementation may restrict write access to associations they supervise. (Currently Admin for write ops).
- **Any Authenticated User**: Read-only access to list and retrieve associations.

**Filtering & Pagination**:
- Standard pagination is supported for list views.
- Filtering capabilities (e.g., by name, city, supervisor) can be added via `django-filter` integration with the `AssociationViewSet`.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request:

- `200 OK`: The request was successful
- `201 Created`: A new resource was successfully created
- `204 No Content`: The request was successful but there is no content to return
- `400 Bad Request`: The request was malformed or invalid
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication failed or not provided
- `403 Forbidden`: The authenticated user doesn't have permission to access the resource
- `404 Not Found`: The requested resource was not found
- `405 Method Not Allowed`: The HTTP method is not allowed for the requested endpoint
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred on the server

All error responses include a detail message that provides more information about the error:

```json
{
    "detail": "Error message describing what went wrong"
}
```

Validation errors return a 400 Bad Request status code with field-specific error messages:

```json
{
    "field_name": [
        "Error message for this field"
    ],
    "another_field": [
        "Error message for another field"
    ]
}
```

---

## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage and protect against abuse, API requests are subject to rate limiting. The current rate limits are:

- Anonymous requests: 60 requests per hour
- Authenticated requests: 1000 requests per hour

When a rate limit is exceeded, the API returns a 429 Too Many Requests status code with headers indicating the rate limit and when it will reset:

```
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1620414000
```

The `X-RateLimit-Reset` header contains a Unix timestamp indicating when the rate limit will reset.

---

## Pagination

List endpoints return paginated results to ensure optimal performance. The default page size is 20 items, but you can customize this with the `page_size` query parameter (up to a maximum of 100).

Pagination information is included in the response:

```json
{
    "count": 100,
    "next": "http://localhost:8000/api/endpoint/?page=2",
    "previous": null,
    "results": [
        // List of items
    ]
}
```

Use the `next` and `previous` URLs to navigate through the pages.

---

## Versioning

The API uses URL-based versioning to ensure backward compatibility. The current version is v1, which is the default if no version is specified.

To explicitly specify a version, include it in the Accept header:

```
Accept: application/json; version=1.0
```

---

## Testing the API

### Using Swagger UI

You can test all API endpoints through the Swagger UI interface:

1. Navigate to `/swagger/` in your browser
2. Click on the "Authorize" button and enter your JWT token
3. Explore the available endpoints and test them directly from the interface

### Using curl

Example of obtaining a token using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/token/" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "password"}'
```

Example of using the token to access a protected endpoint:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/users/me/" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Issues**
   - Ensure you're including the token in the correct format: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
   - Verify that your token hasn't expired
   - If expired, use the refresh token to obtain a new access token

2. **Permission Issues**
   - Verify that your user account has the necessary permissions for the action
   - Check that you're using the correct HTTP method for the endpoint

3. **Validation Errors**
   - Make sure all required fields are included in your request
   - Check that field values meet the validation requirements
